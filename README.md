# # Indoor Navigation and Location based services using BFS,DFS,A* and Dijkstra Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for an AI project conducted at BITS Hyderabad under the guidance of Professor Jabez Christopher. 
The project focused on analyzing various algorithms for inland navigation to determine the most effective solution.
### Goal
The primary goal of this project was to evaluate and compare different algorithms for inland navigation, seeking the most efficient and accurate solution. 
### Professor
- Professor Jabez Christopher

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the implemented algorithms.
- `gui/`: To interact with and visualize the results of your algorithm analysis.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project, including this README file.

## Algorithms Explored

1. Algorithm 1: Breadth-first Search Algorithm
2. Algorithm 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. Algorithm 3: A* Algorithm
4. Algorithm 4: Depth-first Search Algorithm

## GUI Usage

In addition to the algorithms, we have also developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience. You can find the GUI file in the `gui/` directory.
### Prerequisites

- Any code compiler 

### Installation
